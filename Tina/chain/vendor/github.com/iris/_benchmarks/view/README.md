# View Engine Benchmarks

Benchmark between all 8 supported template parsers.

Amber, Ace and Pug parsers minifies the template before render. So, to have a fair benchmark, we must make sure that the byte amount of the total response body is exactly the same across all. Therefore, all other template files are minified too.

## Terminology

**Name** is the name of the template engine used under a particular test.

**Reqs/sec** is the avg number of total requests could be processed per second (the higher the better).

**Latency** is the amount of time it takes from when a request is made by the client to the time it takes for the response to get back to that client (the smaller the better).

**Throughput** is the rate of production or the rate at which data are transferred (the higher the better, it depends from response length (body + headers).

**Time To Complete** is the total time (in seconds) the test completed (the smaller the better).

## Results

### Test:Template Layout, Partial and Data

ðŸ“– Fires 1000000 requests with 125 concurrent clients. It receives HTML response. The server handler sets some template **data** and renders a template file which consists of a **layout** and a **partial** footer.
